- Sophris is developing AI-powered software to verify and validate circuit board schematics
- The company aims to detect design errors early in the development process, preventing costly delays and re-spins
- Founded by a team of engineers with experience at AMD, NASA, and Zipline
- Graduated from Y Combinator's Winter 2025 batch

## Tech & Services

- AI-powered tool that automatically reviews circuit board schematics to find errors
- Analyzes component datasheets to extract specifications and requirements
- Cross-references design requirements against schematic implementation
- Detects common errors like pin mismatches, connectivity gaps, and voltage conflicts
- Provides real-time guidance through an AI chat interface for designers
- Goes beyond traditional Design Rule Checking (DRC) by understanding component-specific requirements

## Key Competency

- **Deep Technical Validation**: Identifies subtle errors that traditional EDA tools miss by analyzing datasheets and cross-referencing design requirements
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces schematic review time from days or weeks to minutes or seconds
- **Cost Reduction**: Prevents expensive re-spins by catching errors during the design phase rather than after production
- **AI-Enhanced Design Process**: Uses AI to augment engineering knowledge rather than replace it
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Checks both basic connectivity and component-specific requirements

## Market Opportunity

- **PCB Design Market**: The global printed circuit board market is growing rapidly with increasing electronics complexity
- **High-Risk Industries**: Targeting sectors where design errors are particularly costly:
  - Aerospace and defense
  - Automotive electronics
  - Medical devices
  - High-performance computing
  - Consumer electronics
  - Deep tech (drones, satellites, space technologies)
- **Engineering Resource Optimization**: Addresses the shortage of experienced hardware engineers by making reviews more efficient

## Competitive Landscape

- **Traditional EDA Tools**: Established design tools like Altium, Cadence, and KiCad offer basic Design Rule Checking but lack deep datasheet analysis
- **Manual Reviews**: Currently, most companies rely on senior engineers' manual reviews, which is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Emerging AI Tools**: A new category of AI-assisted design tools is beginning to emerge in the hardware space
- **Potential Competitors**: Other startups may be targeting similar problems, such as verification and validation tools in the hardware development space

## Technology Background

The PCB design verification process traditionally involves:
1. Basic Design Rule Checking (DRC) in EDA tools that verify spacing, connectivity, and basic electrical rules
2. Manual reviews by senior engineers to catch complex or subtle errors
3. Reference to multiple component datasheets to ensure proper implementation

Sophris disrupts this flow by:
1. Automatically extracting component specifications from datasheets
2. Creating a unified set of design requirements
3. Verifying the schematic against these requirements using AI
4. Flagging potential issues with clear explanations and references
5. Providing a chat interface for designers to understand and resolve issues

## Future Outlook

- Integration with popular EDA tools for seamless workflow
- Expansion into PCB layout verification beyond schematics
- Potential to evolve into a full co-design AI assistant for hardware engineers
- Growth opportunities in specialized markets requiring high reliability and safety certification
- Collection of design pattern data could lead to predictive capabilities for future optimizations
