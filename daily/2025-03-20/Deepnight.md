- Deepnight is developing next-generation night vision technology using AI software rather than traditional expensive hardware
- The company leverages standard digital cameras with advanced AI algorithms to see in near-total darkness
- Founded by two former Google software engineers who have been friends since childhood
- Graduated from Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch

## Tech & Services

- AI-powered software that transforms standard low-light digital camera inputs into clear night vision imagery
- Works with off-the-shelf $50 smartphone cameras, eliminating the need for expensive specialized hardware
- Processes images at 90 frames per second (fps) for real-time viewing
- Delivers color night vision with a full field of view
- Technology inspired by a 2018 academic paper titled "Learning to See in the Dark"
- Software can be integrated with various hardware platforms (goggles, helmets, drones, vehicles)

## Key Competency

- **Software-First Approach**: Transforming night vision from an expensive hardware problem ($13,000-$30,000 per device) into a software solution that works on affordable hardware
- **Military Validation**: Secured contracts with U.S. Army, Air Force, and industry partners like SRI International
- **Market Disruption**: Challenging a multi-billion-dollar industry dominated by analog technology and major defense contractors
- **Edge AI Processing**: Leveraging modern AI accelerators in system-on-chips (SoCs) to run sophisticated computer vision at high frame rates
- **Versatile Applications**: Technology applicable across military, automotive, security, drone, maritime, and consumer applications

## Market Opportunity

- **Military Market**: Potentially disrupting the $22 billion Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) project and traditional night vision procurement
- **Commercial Applications**: Security cameras, automotive night vision, drones, and recreational uses
- **Cost Advantage**: Traditional night vision goggles cost $13,000-$30,000, while Deepnight's solution works with $50 cameras
- **Global Demand**: Night vision technologies have applications across defense, law enforcement, search and rescue, wildlife observation, and consumer markets

## Competitive Landscape

- **Traditional Players**: L3Harris and Elbit America dominate military night vision hardware
- **Defense Tech Startups**: Potentially competing with Anduril (which has taken over the IVAS program from Microsoft)
- **Camera Companies**: SionyX (already a partner) and other digital camera manufacturers
- **Research Organizations**: SRI International (already a partner)

## Technology Background

The traditional night vision technology uses analog image intensifier tubes that amplify available light through a chemical process. This hardware-focused approach has limitations:
- Expensive ($13,000-$30,000 per device)
- Limited field of view
- Monochrome (typically green) display
- Bulky equipment
- Cannot be integrated with digital systems

Deepnight's innovation transforms this paradigm by:
1. Using standard digital CMOS sensors to capture extremely dim light
2. Applying sophisticated AI algorithms to interpret and enhance the limited signal
3. Processing the enhanced feed in real-time at 90 fps
4. Delivering clear, full-color, wide field-of-view night vision
5. Enabling software-based features like streaming and object recognition

## Future Outlook

- Expanding applications beyond military into automotive, security, drones, and consumer markets
- Potential partnerships with hardware manufacturers across various industries
- Continued R&D to improve capability in extreme low-light conditions
- Scaling production of software licenses as adoption grows
- Possible expansion into related computer vision challenges beyond night vision
